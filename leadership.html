                    <p>
                        Theo likes drinking water and dislikes men. But he prides himself in thinking that he knows what postmodernism means.
                        He has not taken AP Biology, AP Chemistry, or AT Envrionmental Science. 
                        He spends most of his waking hours in FRC (robotics) or playing frisbee.

                    <h3>Junior Officer: Ryan Lee (he/him)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ryan is currently a junior in his 6th year at SAS.
                        Having taken an interest in science since he was young, he has enjoyed just about all his science classes he has taken so far in high school, from Accelerated Biology and AP Chemistry to his current (get it) class, AT Computational Physics.
                        He also enjoys writing practice tests, having written 17 science-related practice tests so far and counting. Outside of his science classes, he enjoys participating in and leading a variety of other clubs and activities, being a House VP in StuCo and an officer of Math Club and Academic Quiz Club.
                        Additionally, he enjoys playing the piano, percussion, chess, doing service, and ranting about seniority at SAS.
                        When he’s not at school, he’s most likely in some form of meeting over Zoom, but you can always reach him at lee46079@sas.edu.sg.

                    <h3>Junior Officer: Advay Ratan (he/him)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Advay joined SAS in 7th grade. Ever since a young age, Advay always questioned how the things around him work, leading him to be increasingly interested in science as the years passed. He thoroughly enjoys the science courses he has taken in SAS, including Accelerated Biology, Accelerated Chemistry, AT Computational Physics, and is currently taking AP Chem. He became a member of SNHS in his sophomore year and is a junior officer at the moment. In his free time, Advay likes coding, playing the guitar, watching YouTube, and talking to his alternate personalities.
